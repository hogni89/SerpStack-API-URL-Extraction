Using SerpStack API to extract URLs

Extracting URL for each product using Serpstack API

-> 'scrape_url.py' is a python file which contains source code that I've written to extract URL for each product using
the Serpstack API using the given Google search code in the assignment file.
All the URL respective to given google search code are written in same order in 'URL.csv' file. 
As some of the search-codes didnot return any URL, so they are marked as "Null" in the 'URL.csv' file.
